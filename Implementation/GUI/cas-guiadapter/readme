GUIAdapter Overview

The GUIAdapter provides a Interface called IGUIAdapter
which must be implemented by user of this adapter.
The Implementation has the method message(byte[] reuqest)
which is called on incoming message. 
This method has the incoming message as parameter
and choose the rtc business methods and returns
 the answer as byte array. Its recommended to
 extends the AbstractGUIAdapter, because its initiates
 the internal message handler.
 You can also send with your GUIAdapter messages with the 
 sendMessages(byte[] message) method.
 You only have to initiate your IGUIAdapter impelementation to run
 the adapter.
 
Configuration


You have to implement like 
Config config(){ 
	return new Config("localhost",5672, "guest","guest")
}
in your IGUIAdapter impelementation your own configuration.
The handler needs this information.
Config.official and Config.localhost are predefined.

Example

import org.haw.cas.guiadapter.AbstractGUIAdapter;
import org.haw.cas.guiadapter.data.config.Config;
public class MyAdapter extends AbstractGUIAdapter{
	protected Config config() {
		return Config.localhost;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new MyAdapter();
	}

	@Override
	public byte[] getMessage(byte[] arg0) {
		return "foo".getBytes();
	}

}
 
Project structure

- build.sbt: Configuration for simple build tools (see Building project)
- src/main/java/*: generated Java classes (*.java)


Building project

You need to install sbt 0.13 to build project: 
http://www.scala-sbt.org/
sbt is a project builder for java or scala projects

In terminal from project root, you can run:

sbt build

If you want to build eclipse projects, you have to declare de eclipse plugin
in <homedirectory>/.sbt/plugins.sbt:

resolvers += Classpaths.typesafeResolver

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.3.0")

In terminal from project root, you can run:
sbt eclipse

to build a eclipse directory.
With or without eclipse project generation you get the project dependency:
protobuf util classes
