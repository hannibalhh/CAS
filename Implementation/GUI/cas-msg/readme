Project structure

- build.sbt: Configuration for simple build tools (see Building project)
- messages/*: protobuf messges (*.proto)
- src/main/java/*: generated Java classes (*.java)


Building project

You need to install sbt 0.13 to build project: 
http://www.scala-sbt.org/
sbt is a project builder for java or scala projects

In terminal from project root, you can run:

sbt build

If you want to build eclipse projects, you have to declare de eclipse plugin
in <homedirectory>/.sbt/plugins.sbt:

resolvers += Classpaths.typesafeResolver

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.3.0")

In terminal from project root, you can run:
sbt eclipse

to build a eclipse directory.
With or without eclipse project generation you get the project dependency:
protobuf util classes

 
Building java classes with proto files

You have to install protobuf 2.5.0.
Your working directory is project root.
Than, you run the protobufcompiler.
Input is your directory (means: ./)
Java output is ./output
Than you choose your proto files (messages/...).
Java files can you find in  output/<package declared in .proto file>/<message>.java

Example for needs/NeedsMessage.proto  

protoc -I=./ --java_out=output/ messages/common/AkkaMessage.proto
